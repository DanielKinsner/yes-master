## 2026-05-11 — Phase 0: Workspace scaffold and architecture ADR

Goal:

Take the Claude-build repo from zero-state to a buildable Tauri 2.x shell with the architecture lock recorded in `docs/adr/0001-tauri-rust-stack.md`.

What changed:

- Rewrote `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the Claude build. Preserved the phase wisdom from the Codex-authored version; reframed Phase 0 as "workspace scaffold + ADR" instead of "canon and repo baseline"; replaced Codex verification commands with Claude-build-native commands; updated module list and typed command list to match the zero-state assumption.
- Wrote ADR 0001 locking Tauri 2.x shell + React/TS frontend + Rust audio engine, with JUCE and Rust-native UI documented as reversible fallbacks.
- Scaffolded the workspace:
  - Root: `package.json`, `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`.
  - Frontend in `src/`: `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `App.css`, `vite-env.d.ts`.
  - Tauri app in `src-tauri/`: `Cargo.toml`, `tauri.conf.json`, `build.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs` with empty module declarations for `audio`, `engine`, `exports`, `files`, `jobs`, `project`, `settings`.
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` with the minimum permission set.

Verification:

- `npm install` — 74 packages, 0 vulnerabilities. `@types/node ^25.7.0` was added during the run because `vite.config.ts` references `process.env.TAURI_DEV_HOST` and TypeScript needed Node types.
- `npm run build` — frontend builds cleanly via `tsc -b && vite build`. `dist/` produced (~196 KB pre-gzip).
- `cargo check` (from `src-tauri/`) — clean after a placeholder `icon.ico` was added; `tauri-build` requires it for the Windows resource file even with `bundle.active = false`. The placeholder icon is a 64×64 dark "A" generated via .NET `System.Drawing`; it should be replaced with a real icon in Phase 14.
- `cargo test` (from `src-tauri/`) — 0 tests, all 0 pass. Contract/unit tests start in Phase 1.

Real-audio fixture used: none. Phase 0 has no audio path yet.

What failed or remains partial:

- `npm run tauri dev` requires an interactive window and is not verified in this automated pass; deferred to manual verification on the dev machine.
- `tauri build` is intentionally not attempted; signing and proper icons belong to Phase 14.
- No DSP, no audio I/O, no playback. Phase 1 starts the typed command layer; Phase 3 brings real audio.
- The placeholder `src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` is committed (2.6 KB) so the workspace builds out of the box; replace in Phase 14.

Next recommended slice:

Phase 1 — typed Rust app foundation. Define the command list with stub implementations and contract tests. Start with `analyze_tracks`, `prepare_waveform`, and `prepare_source_playback` since those unblock Phase 2's frontend skeleton.
